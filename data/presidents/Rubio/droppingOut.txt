America's in the middle of a real political storm, a real tsunami, and we should have seen this coming.

The politics of resentment against other people will not just leave us a fractured party. They're gonna leave us a fractured nation. They're gonna leave us as a nation where people literally hate each other because they have different political opinions.
This nation needs a vibrant and growing conservative movement, and it needs a strong Republican party to change the direction now of this country, or many of the things going wrong in America will become permanent and many of the things that make us a special country will be gone.
America needs a vibrant conservative movement, but one that's built on principles and on ideas, not on fear, not on anger, not on preying on people's frustrations.
And it wasn't until Rubio got all those sentiments about the state of politics in the U.S. out of his system that he finally dropped a news bomb on the nation by subtly mentioning that he would be suspending his presidential campaign:

But after tonight, it is clear that while we are on the right side, this year, we will not be on the winning side. I take great comfort in the ancient words which teaches us that in their hearts, humans plan their course, but the Lord establishes their steps.
While it is not God's plan that I be president in 2016, or maybe ever, and while today my campaign is suspended, the fact that I've even come this far is evidence of how special America truly is, and all the reason more why we must do all we can to ensure that this nation remains a special place.
