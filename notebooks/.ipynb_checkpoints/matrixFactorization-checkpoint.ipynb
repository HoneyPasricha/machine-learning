    "Let's say we work in a vinyl record and CD store downtown. A customer comes in and asks us for a recommendation. We ask the obvious question \"What do you like?\" and she responds with \"I like Taylor Swift and Carrie Underwood.\" There are several ways we might come up with a recommendation for her. One is to reflect on regular customers to our store who bought albums from those artists and think what else they bought. Perhaps we notice that recently, people who bought Taylor Swift CDs also bought CDs by Miranda Lambert and we recommend Miranda Lambert to the new customer. This is a two step process. First, we determine previous customers who are most similar to the person standing in front of us and second, we look at what those previous customers bought and then use that information to make recommendations to our current customer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way we might come up with a recommendation is as follows. We know Taylor Swift and Carrie Underwood CDs share certain features. They both, obviously, have prominent female vocals. They both feature singer-songwriters They both have country influences and no PBR&B influences (the term PBR&B, aka hipster R&B and R neg B, is a portmanteau of PBR--Pabst Blue Ribbon, the hipster beer of choice--and R&B).  Then we think \"Hey, Miranda Lambert CDs also have prominent female vocals and have country influences but no PBR&B influences, and we recommend Miranda Lambert to our new customer. With this recommendation method we extract a set of features from CDs this person likes and then think what other CDs share these features. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's check this out a bit further. We will restrict ourselves to two features (country and PBR&B influences), five artists (Taylor Swift, Miranda Lambert,  Carrie Underwood, Jhené Aiko, and The Weeknd) and two customers (Jake and Ann).  As owners of the vinyl record store we have gone through and meticulously rated artists on these features. \n",

We get $\\hat{R}$ by multiplying the *P* and *Q* matrices together.  Here's the thing about multipying matrices. To multiply matrices one matrix needs to have the same number of columns as the other has rows. If you look at *P* and *Q* above you can see that this is not the case. To make this work out mathematically, we need to flip one of the matrices on-end so that the rows become the columns. Let's do this for matrix Q. So *Q* originally is \n",

    "## How do we get Matrices P and Q?\n",
    "There are several common ways to derive these matrices. One method is called **stochastic gradient descent.** The basic idea is this. We are going to randomly select values for *P* and *Q*.  For example, we would randomly select initial values for Jake:\n",
    "\n",
    "Jake = [0.03, 0.88]\n",
    "\n",
    "and randomly select initial values for Taylor Swift:\n",
    "\n",
    "Taylor = [ 0.73,  0.49]\n",
    "\n",
    "So with those initial ratings we get a prediction of \n",
    "$$J \\cdot  S = 0.03 \\times 0.73 +  0.88 \\times 0.49 = 0.45$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is a particularly bad guess considering Jake really gave Taylor Swift a '5'. So we adjust those values. We underestimated Jake's rating of Taylor Swift so we boost maybe something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "Jake = [0.12, 0.83]\n",
    "\n",
    "Taylor = [ 0.80,  0.47]\n",
    "\n",
    "and now we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$J \\cdot  S = 0.12 \\times 0.80 +  0.83 \\times 0.47 = 0.49$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is better than before but still we underestimated so we adust and try again. And adjust and try again. We repeat this process thousands of times until our predicted values get close to the actual values. The general algorithm is\n",
    "\n",
    "1. generate random values for the P and Q matrices\n",
    "2. using these P and Q matrices estimate the ratings (for ex., Jake's rating of Taylor Swift).\n",
    "3. compute the error between the actual rating and our estimated rating (for example, Jake actually gave Taylor Swift a '5' but using P and Q we estimated the rating to be 0.45. Our error was 4.55.  Let's call this $e_{Jake,Taylor}$\n",
    "4. using this error adjust P and Q to improve our estimate\n",
    "5. If our total error rate is small enough or we have gone through a bunch of iterations (for ex., 4000) terminate the algorithm. Else go to step 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "For how simple this algorithm is, it works surprisingly well. And that is the algorithm we are going to implement.\n",
